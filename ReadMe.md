# ReadMe file to run project one

1. Unzip the folder.

2. Double click on .py file.

3. If you run the code it will create three files Nodes, nodePath and NodesInfo in .txt format.

4. New files will be created and these files will overwrite the previous text files if you re-run the code.

5. I used Pycharm as my IDE and for best results please open the code with Pycharm.

6. The libraries used are random,itertools,collections and copy.
